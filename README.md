Joda-Money-Calculator

Joda-Money-Calculator provides a calculator to manipulate Joda Money objects. Please see https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-money/ and http://joda-money.sourceforge.net/apidocs/ for further details This work is otherwise unsupported by them.

It was inspired by a couple of requests on the joda-money project, which seemed to want to extend the joda-money project beyond it's stated aims, and I thought it might be useful as an addition.

All operations use BigMoney and (BigDecimal where required), so will be 'lossless' as far as these are concerned.

The source project itself has used the joda-money sources, and is deeply indebted to them.
